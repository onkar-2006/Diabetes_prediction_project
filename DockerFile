# 1. Use Python 3.10 to match your local environment
FROM python:3.10-slim

# 2. Set the main working directory
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy and install requirements first (for better caching)

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 4. Copy the folders as they are in your project
# This recreates /app/Backend and /app/model inside Docker
COPY Backend/ ./Backend/
COPY model/ ./model/

# 5. Move into the Backend folder so Uvicorn can find main.py
WORKDIR /app/Backend

# 6. Expose the port
EXPOSE 8000

# 7. Run the application
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
